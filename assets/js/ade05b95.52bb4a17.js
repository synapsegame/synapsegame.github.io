Balanced values a bit more\\n- Adjusted rarity scaling through levels to increase chance of rarer items in latest levels\\n- Corrected a sneaky bug in the perk rarity selection logic. Unfortunately for players, rarer perks are now... rarer.

The fire rate could probably be reduced significantly on the SMG\\n- [[Bug]] enemy projectiles are not despawned at the end of the level. add an event listener to the projectiles to check for the level end event, OR, parent them to a collection and then destroy the contents of that collection\\n- [[GameFeel]] also, add an attack cooldown randomized interval to spiders so that they\'re not casting the wave of projectiles like they are in this version\\n- [[Balance]] For each level / wave, it would be good to scale the spawn sizes throughout each wave. So when the wave starts, get the maximum spawn size/ from the previous round and the current round, and then using the wave duration, scale the number of units to spawn so that the last 30 seconds are spawning with the full wave capacity.\\n- [[Bug]] Synthlegs movement reduced from 2000% to 400%\\n- [[GameFeel]] Reduced spider movement speed\\n- [[Balance]] Maybe add a stat ceiling for stats that get initialized in the `UnitStats` method so that units are not scaling uncontrollably in the later levels\\n- Armored space mites now have a chance to consume cells, incentivizing player to pick them up\\n- Added confirmation double tap to reroll buttons and sell item button\\n- [[Interface]] Item modifiers displayed on the death/final screen\\n\\n# New Items\\n\\n- armor piercing rounds: +10% damage, -2.5% fire rate\\n- Added rare item which provides +5 health\\n- Bipod: +10% Attack Range, -5% movement speed\\n- Ocular implants: +75 range\\n-\\n\\n# Bugfix\\n\\n- Try to figure out why loading between scenes is causing some fonts to be discarded\\n- The confirm button is not resetting after time.
